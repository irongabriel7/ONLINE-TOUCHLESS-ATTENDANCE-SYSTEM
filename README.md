# ONLINE TOUCHLESS ATTENDANCE SYSTEM
 An online RFID attendance system which can help people working for daily wages to mark their attendance accurately. It enables them to mark their attendance at their respective sites of work without directly reporting to headquarters using RFID tag which can be integrated into their ID card. This helps in decreasing the crowding for marking attendance and thereby reduces the spread of COVID. The Attendance system has enormous benefits as it can be developed at an affordable rate and can be implemented anywhere, just a internet hotspot is required. With it maintaining daily attendance on Google Spreadsheets without any Human control, no data will be lost and it can sorted in any way as per required.
